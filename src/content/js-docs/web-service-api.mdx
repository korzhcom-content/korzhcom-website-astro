## About EasyQuery Web Service

EasyQuery Web Service is a specification of the server-side API that handles requests from the client-side EasyQuery widgets.
This API includes a few endpoints that allow you (as a developer) to implement some basic scenarios of advanced database search,
data filtering or ad-hoc reporting.

The only implementation of the API is available for now as a part [EasyQuery for ASP.NET Core](https://korzh.com/easyquery) library.

## Endpoints

### GetModel

`GET /models/{modelId}`

Returns the model by its ID

### GetQuery

`GET /models/{modelId}/queries/{queryId}`

Returns the query by model's ID and query ID

### SaveQuery

`PUT /models/{modelId}/queries/{queryId}`

Saves the query defined by `modelId` and `queryId` to the storage on the server.
The content of the request is a JSON object that contains the query definition:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "id": "MyQueryID",
  }
}
```

### NewQuery

`POST /models/{modelId}/queries`

Creates a new query for the model defined in `modelId` and returns it to the client
The content of the request is a JSON object that might contain the query definition (including the preferable ID and name of the new query).
If there is no `query` property in the request content - a default query with some random ID will be created.

```json
{
  "query": {
    "id": "MyQueryID",
  }
}
```

### RemoveQuery

`DELETE /models/{modelId}/queries/{queryId}`


### GetQueryList

`GET /models/{modelId}/queries`

Returns the list of the queries for specified model (`modelId`) available for the current user.
The response is a JSON object with the list of query definitions:

```json
[
  {
    "id":"Query1ID",
  },
  {
    "id":"Query2ID",
  },
]
```

### SyncQuery

`POST /models/{modelId}/queries/{queryId}/sync`

Synchronizes the changes made in the query on the client-side with the server.
The content of the request is a JSON object which contains the query definition.

```json
{
  "query": {
    "id": "MyQueryID",
  }
}
```

### FetchData

`POST /models/{modelId}/fetch`

This request allows to execute the query passed in the request's body and get the result set in a format, compatible with [Googles DataTable](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/datatables_dataviews#javascriptliteral).
Here `modelId` defines the model this query belongs to and can be used on the server side to specify the database and connection to it (if it's a multi-database application).

The content of the request, as usual, is a JSON object which contains the query definition and chunk (a piece of data) we would like to get.
Here is an example:

```json
{
  "chunk": {
      "offset": 0,
      "limit": 1000,
      "needTotal": true //defines if we need to get the total number of recrods as well
  },
  "query": {
    "id": "MyQueryID",
  },
  "options": {
    "sqlOptions": {
      "SelectDistinct": true
    },
  }
}
```

The response contains the result set itself (`resultSet` property) and some meta information (`meta`) field about the returned data. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "resultSet": {
    "cols": [
      {
        "id": "col-3g8xzmshiiok",
        "label": "Name",
        "type": 1,
        "originAttrId": "Product.ProductName",
      },
      {
        "id": "col-5f8xzmshiqw3",
        "isAggr": true,
        "label": "Freight Sum",
        "type": 8,
        "originAttrId": "Order.Freight",
      }
    ],
    "rows": [
      [
        "Alice Mutton",
        219.07
      ],
      [
        "Aniseed Syrup",
        8.53
      ],
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "totalRecords": 66,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```


### GetValueList

`GET /models/{modelId}/valuelists/{editorId}`

Get the list of values by the model specified via `modelId` parameter and the value editor specified via `editorId`.
The response is a JSON object that contains the list of object with `id` and `text` properties each. Example:

```json
{
  "result":"ok",
	"values":[
	  {"id":"SouthAmerica", "text": "South America", items: [
	    {"id":"AR","text":"Argentina"},
	  ]},
	  {"id":"Europe", "text": "Europe", items: [
	    {"id":"AT","text":"Austria"},
	  ]},
	]
}
```

As you can see the result list can be hirerachical (so, each item can include sub-items).

### Export

`POST /models/{modelId}/export/{format}`

This operation exports the result of the query with indicated `modelId`  to the specified `format` (e.g. "csv" or "pdf").

The content of the request is a JSON object that contains the query definition:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "id": "MyQueryID",
  }
}
```

The response is a stream of the data in a specified format or a JSON object with the error message.
