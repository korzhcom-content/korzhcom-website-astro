EasyQuery.JS is a platform-independent solution that allows you to embed an ad hoc reporting or advanced search functionality to your web application.

It gives you a simple to use but powerful user interface to build a query or a filter to your data. Your end-users will get the power of SQL, even if they can't pronounce it properly. All the complexity is hidden from the end-user - just simple to use and easy to learn UI.

It doesn't matter what server-side platform/language you use - either Java, PHP, NodeJS or something else. EasyQuery.JS covers them all, requiring a minimum additional code to get things worked.
