EasyQuery.JS is a platform-independent solution that allows you to embed an ad hoc reporting or advanced search functionality to your web application.

It gives you a simple to use but powerful user interface to build a query or a filter to your data. Your end-users will get the power of SQL, even if they can't pronounce it properly. All the complexity is hidden from the end-user - just simple to use and easy to learn UI.

It doesn't matter what server-side platform/language you use - either Java, PHP, NodeJS or something else. EasyQuery.JS covers them all, requiring a minimum additional code to get things worked.

```javascript
import {defineConfig} from 'astro/config'
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx"
import {readingTime} from "./src/js/reading-time.js"

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
    site: 'https://korzh.com',
    compressHTML: false,
    markdown: {
        shikiConfig: {
            theme: 'github-light',
            langs: [],
            wrap: false
        },
        remarkPlugins: [
            readingTime,
        ],
    },
    integrations: [
        mdx(),
    ]
});
```
